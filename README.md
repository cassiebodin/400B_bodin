This repository will contain all work for the Astr400B, a class on Cosmology and Galaxy Evolution.

"ASTR400B_2020" is linked to a github repository created by the teacher, Professor Gurtina Besla, which contains all assignments and sample code.
"Homeworks" contains the class coding homeworks that created programs utilized in the final research assignment. It utilized data from the Milky Way- Andromeda collision simulation data.
"Labs" contains programs written in class with Professor Besla, to analyze different aspecrts of galaxies, as well as, familiarize ourselves with various coding practices and formats in python.
"Lectures" contains a file that we used in lecture 3 of the course.
"Research_Assignment" contains the final research assignment for the course, both the code for the assignment, the proposal, and the final report. The research topic I chose was on the 3D dark matter distribution within the dark matter halos of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies before, during, and after the merging event between the two galaxies.
