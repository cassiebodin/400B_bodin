# 400B_bodin
### This repository will contain all work for the Astr400B, a class on Cosmology and Galaxy Evolution.

"ASTR400B_2020" is linked to a github repository created by the teacher, Professor Gurtina Besla, which contains all assignments and sample code. 

"Homeworks" contains the class coding homeworks that created programs utilized in the final research assignment. It utilized data from the Milky Way- Andromeda collision simulation data.
 * Homework1 - first commit. 
 * Homework2 - ReadFile.py, code to read in any of the simulation files. 
 * Homework3 - GalaxyMass.py, code to interpret the simulation files and extract the mass of each particle type (dark matter halo, disk, or bulge) for each of the major galaxies in the local group (Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum).
 * Homework4 - CenterOfMass.py, calculates the center of mass positions and velocities for different particles for a selected simulation file.
 * Homework5 - MassProfile.py, calculates/plots the mass profiles and rotation curves for a particle types for a selected simulation file.
 * Homework6 - OrbitCOM.py, calculates the simulated center of mass orbits for all the simulation data and plots the orbital distance vs time between MW-M31 and M33-M31, as well as the relative velocity vs time between the same galaxies.
 * Homework7 - M33AnalyticOrbit.py, calculates the analytic center of mass orbits for all the simulation data using integration and plots both the simulated and analytic data for distance vs time for M31-M33, as well as the relative velocity vs time between the same galaxies.

"Labs" contains programs written in class with Professor Besla, to analyze different aspecrts of galaxies, as well as, familiarize ourselves with various coding practices and formats in python.

"Lectures" contains a file that we used in lecture 3 of the course.

"Research_Assignment" contains the final research assignment for the course, both the code for the assignment, the proposal, and the final report. The research topic I chose was on the 3D dark matter distribution within the dark matter halos of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies before, during, and after the merging event between the two galaxies. 
 * Assignment1 - topic chosen. 
 * Assignment2 - research proposal. 
 * Assignment3,5,7 - code in python written for the project. 
 * Assignment4,6 - portions of reseach paper. 
 * FinalResearchAssignment- final code and research paper.
